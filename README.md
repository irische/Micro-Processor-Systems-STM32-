# Micro-Processor-Systems-STM32-
- Project using STM32 micro-processing controller
- Achieved goals including
  - Write a program to display messages on an ANSI terminal with attributes for position, color, background color, and animation 
  - Create a service routine that performs a function on the occurrence of an IRQ hardware interrupt and use a counter to control the accurate timing of a stopwatch display
  - Connect RS-232 and SPI devices to the STM32 microcontroller and write programs to pass data to and from them
  - Develop a routine to read an analog input on an ADC port, use a MAC to implement a 2nd order digital filter, and output the resultant analog voltage
  - Employ Direct Memory Access modules (DMA) to reduce peripheral computational overhead
  - Configure the microcontroller as a USB host and device or interact with a Controller Area Network (CAN) bus.
